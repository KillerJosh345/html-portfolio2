        Life doesnt move the way we want like the breeze, the tides, and the insects which flutter over it.<br>
        Eventhough I wanted to become a chemist, it doesn't have much scope or requirement where I live.<br>
        Anyways, I always loved coding, and will. It is metaphorous to gain as much as knowledge before the world forgets you.<br>
        <strong>I am Joshua and I will learn what the world has to offer.</strong>
